# Tick-cross
 This  **Tick-Cross** (Tic-Tac-Toe) game in C++ is a two-player game played on a 3x3 grid where players alternate placing 'X' or 'O'. The goal is to align three marks in a row, column, or diagonal. The program checks for a winner after each move and ends when a player wins or the game results in a draw.
